1,"Fluctuations in economic time series are caused by seasonal, cyclical and irregular movements. A seasonally adjusted series is one from which seasonal movements have been eliminated. Seasonal movements are defined as those which are caused by regular annual events such as climate, holidays, vacation periods and cycles related to crops, production and retail sales associated with Christmas and Easter. It should be noted that the seasonally adjusted series contain irregular as well as longer-term cyclical fluctuations. The seasonal adjustment program is a complicated computer program which differentiates between these seasonal, cyclical and irregular movements in a series over a number of years and, on the basis of past movements, estimates appropriate seasonal factors for current data. On an annual basis, the historic series of seasonally adjusted data are revised in light of the most recent information on changes in seasonality."
2,"Industry refers to the general nature of the business carried out by the employer for whom the respondent works (main job only). Industry estimates in this table are based on the 2022 North American Industry Classification System (NAICS)."
3,"To ensure respondent confidentiality, estimates below a certain threshold are suppressed. For Canada, Quebec, Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia suppression is applied to all data below 1,500. The threshold level for Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Manitoba and Saskatchewan is 500, while in Prince Edward Island, estimates under 200 are suppressed. Census metropolitan areas (CMAs) and economic regions (ERs) use their respective provincial suppression levels mentioned above. Estimates are based on smaller sample sizes the more detailed the table becomes, which could result in lower data quality."

13,"The standard error (SE) of an estimate is an indicator of the variability associated with this estimate, as the estimate is based on a sample rather than the entire population. The SE can be used to construct confidence intervals and calculate coefficients of variation (CVs). The confidence interval can be built by adding the SE to an estimate in order to determine the upper limit of this interval, and by subtracting the same amount from the estimate to determine the lower limit. The CV can be calculated by dividing the SE by the estimate. See Section 7 of the <a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/catalogue/71-543-G#wb-auto-2" rel="external noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Guide to the Labour Force Survey (opens new window)</a> for more information. The standard errors presented in this table are the average of the standard errors for 12 previous months, and are updated twice a year, in February and August."
14,"The standard error (SE) for the month-to-month change is an indicator of the variability associated with the estimate of the change between two consecutive months, because each monthly estimate is based on a sample rather than the entire population. To construct confidence intervals, the SE is added to an estimate in order to determine the upper limit of this interval, and then subtracted from the estimate to determine the lower limit. Using this method, the true value will fall within one SE of the estimate approximately 68% of the time, and within two standard errors approximately 95% of the time. For example, if the estimated employment level increases by 20,000 from one month to another and the associated SE is 29,000, the true value of the employment change has a 68% chance of falling between -9,000 and +49,000. Because such a confidence interval includes zero, the 20,000 change would not be considered statistically significant. However, if the increase is 30,000, the confidence interval would be +1,000 to +59,000, and the 30,000 increase would be considered statistically significant. (Note that 30,000 is above the SE of 29,000, and that the confidence interval does not include zero.) Similarly, if the estimated employment declines by 30,000, then the true value of the decline would fall between -59,000 and -1,000. See Section 7 of the <a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/catalogue/71-543-G" rel="external noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Guide to the Labour Force Survey (opens new window)</a> for more information. The standard errors presented in this table are the average of standard errors for 12 previous months. They are updated twice a year, in February and August. Note that the estimate of the month-to-month change is not included in this table. It can be calculated by taking the estimate level for one month and subtracting from it the estimate level of the previous month."
15,"The standard error (SE) for the year-over-year change is an indicator of the variability associated with the estimate of the change between a given month in a given year and the same month of the previous year, because each month's estimate is based on a sample rather than the entire population. The SE can be used to construct confidence intervals: it can be added to an estimate in order to determine the upper limit of this interval, and then subtracted from the same estimate to determine the lower limit. Using this method, the true value will fall within one SE of the estimate, approximately 68% of the time, and within two standard errors, approximately 95% of the time. For example, if the estimated employment level increases by 160,000 over 12 months and the associated SE is 55,000, the true value of the change in employment has approximately a 68% chance of falling between +105,000 and +215,000. This change would be considered statistically significant at the 68% level as the confidence interval excludes zero. However, if the increase is 40,000, the interval would be -15,000 to +95,000, and this increase would not be considered statistically significant since the interval includes zero. See Section 7 of the <a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/catalogue/71-543-G" rel="external noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Guide to the Labour Force Survey (opens new window)</a> for more information. The standard errors presented in this table are the average of standard errors for 12 previous months and are updated twice a year, in February and August. Note that estimates of the year-over-year change are not included in the tables. They can be calculated by taking the estimate level for a given month in a given year and subtracting from it the estimate level of the same month in the previous year."
